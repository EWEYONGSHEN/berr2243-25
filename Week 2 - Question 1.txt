Question 1: Explain what is CRUD operations and how it is relates to the mongo functions in
the exercise.

Answer:
CRUD = Create, Read, Update, Delete - the only 4 things you can do with data.

MongoDB Equivalents:
CREATE → insertOne() → "Add new driver"
READ → find() → "Find available drivers"
UPDATE → updateOne() → "Change driver's rating"
DELETE → deleteOne() → "Remove driver"

Simple Analogy:
Write new entries (Create)
Read what's written (Read)
Edit existing entries (Update)
Tear out pages (Delete)
